## Voodospark 

"VoodooSpark" is a customized firmware build for Photon and Core to allow a remote interface 
definition of the firmware API over a local TCP connection. The intent is to allow client-side
programs to directly control the 'Particle' devices in real-time regardless of their programming
language."
